         in the market. It will analyse how the integration of solar, wind, hydro, and other renewables is reshaping market dynamics, \
         affecting pricing and the supply-demand balance, and contributing to Australia's transition to a lower-carbon future. The topic \
         may also consider the economic and environmental trade-offs involved, offering insights for strategic energy management and policy formulation.")

            ##### Available Datasets

            For investigating renewable integration in the NEM, you need to consider multiple datasets from different sources and combine them to get a comprehensive view of \
            the renewable energy generation in the NEM. Here are some of the key datasets that you may consider for your analysis.

            You can find the information about generators and their registration details, such as such as fuel source, technology type, capacity, location, and connection points, in the \
            [NEM Registration and Exemption List](https://www.aemo.com.au/-/media/files/electricity/nem/participant_information/nem-registration-and-exemption-list.xlsx?). \
            This dataset is in Excel format. Check `Production Units (PU) and Scheduled Loads` tab for generator details.

            These tables are publicly available \
            on the [NEMWEB](https://aemo.com.au/energy-systems/electricity/national-electricity-market-nem/data-nem/market-data-nemweb). \
            Here lists the relevant table names and features from MMS Data Model used in above example:
            - [`DISPATCH.DISPATCH_UNIT_SCADA`](https://nemweb.com.au/Reports/Current/MMSDataModelReport/Electricity/Electricity%20Data%20Model%20Report.htm): \
            This table contains the real-time MW reading from generators and scheduled loads for each dispatch unit, including renewable energy sources, \
            by SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) systems.
            - [`PARTICIPANT_REGISTRATION.DUDETAILSUMMARY`](https://nemweb.com.au/Reports/Current/MMSDataModelReport/Electricity/Electricity%20Data%20Model%20Report_files/Elec44.htm#60): \
            This table provides detailed information about generator registration, including region, connection point, and capacity details, but does not include fuel type information.
            - Please refer to the [MMS Data Model](https://nemweb.com.au/Reports/Current/MMSDataModelReport/Electricity/Electricity%20Data%20Model%20Report.htm) \
            for detailed information on the data structure and definitions. 
            
            ##### Data Download

            - You can manually download these datasets from the [Monthly Archive](https://visualisations.aemo.com.au/aemo/nemweb/#mms-data-model) section of the NEMWEB portal by month and year. \
                We recommend downloading zipped CSV files for your chosen datasets rather than the entire zipped monthly database. 
            - Alternatively, you can use the out-of-box packages to download these datasets from the NEMWEB portal, such as:
                - Python package: [NEMOSIS](https://github.com/UNSW-CEEM/NEMOSIS)
                - R package: [nemwebR](https://github.com/aleemon/nemwebR) (Limited functionality, last updated in 2022)
            - If you consider the weather data for analysis, you can download the climate data from the \
                [Bureau of Meteorology (BOM)](http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/data/index.shtml).
