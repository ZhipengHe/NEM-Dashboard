## About Project

st.subheader("About Project")

st.markdown('''
        The **National Electricity Market (NEM)** is Australia's interconnected electricity system and wholesale market, \
         supplying power to the eastern and southern states. Covering over 5,000 kilometres, it is \
         one of the world's longest electricity networks, serving more than 10 million customers. The NEM operates as \
         a real-time spot market, where electricity is traded based on supply and demand fluctuations. \
         The **Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO)** manages this market by coordinating electricity generation \
         and consumption every five minutes, ensuring system reliability and efficiency. 

        This dashboard aims to provide insights into the NEM's operation, focusing on four key topics: \
         ***price anomaly detection***, ***outage analysis***, ***renewable integration***, and ***infrastructure analysis***. \
         By analysing historical data, we can identify patterns and trends in the NEM, helping \
         to improve market transparency and decision-making.
